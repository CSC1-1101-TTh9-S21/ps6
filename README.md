# Problem Set 6

### Due Friday, March 19, 2021, at 11:59pm EST

For this problem set, you will submit to Canvas **a single .zip file**. Detailed instructions for what the .zip file should contain are at the end of this problem set. Note that if you do not submit the files as specified here, there will be a major deduction in your grade for this assignment. Following directions to the letter is a crucial skill for computer programming.

**Note:** We now have a new component to our programs: **global variables**! Your programs should all have the following format: import statements (if necessary); the global variables (if there are any); then function definitions (if there are any); then a `main()` function that gets the ball rolling and calls the functions you defined (if any); and finally outide all other functions, the call to `main()`.

### Comments
I now expect you to write comments in your code! Two points will be deducted if you provide no or minimal comments, and 1 point will be deducted if you have sufficient comments but they do not conform to these requirements:

* Before every function, describe what it does and what its arguments are (if any).
* Before every variable, explain what value it is holding or what purpose it serves. (Exception: the variable that helps you go through a `for` loop does not need to be explained, of course!)
* Do not write comments at the end of a line unless they are really short.
* If you have a long comment, insert some line breaks so it doesn't trail off end of the screen.
* Leave a new line before each comment so they are easy to read.

And, as always, in every program, the first four lines (comments) should be:

* The name of the file.
* Your name.
* The date.
* A statement saying "This code is my own work. I did not share my code or look at the code of another student."

## Part 1: Caesar cipher: Brute force
In this program, you will write a program to encode and decode messages written using a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). 
The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who, according to Suetonius, used it to protect messages of military significance. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in a text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a right shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on until W becomes Z; when the end of the alphabet is reached, the cipher wraps around to the front of the alphabet, so X would be replaced by A, Y by B, and Z by C. It is unknown how effective the Caesar cipher was at the time, but it is likely to have been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language. There is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers.


## Part 2: Caesar cipher: Using statistics


## Part 3: Language identification

get all letters
store letter to int mapping as dictionary
calculate percent for each letter for each language -- array
dictionary mapping language -> list of frequencies


get all letters
store letter to int mapping as dictionary
calculate percent for each letter for each language -- array
diciontary 





## Part 4: Solve the Caesar cipher faster!

## What to turn in
If you haven't already, create a `ps5` folder. In your `p5` folder you should have three python scripts: `part1.py`, `part2.py`,  `part3.py`, and `part4.py`. Remove any other things you might have accidentally put in the folder, then zip the folder up using whatever means you normally use to zip things up (e.g., on a Mac, you can right click and select `Compress`).

Upload the `.zip` file you created to Canvas. 

Note that if you do not submit the files as specified here, there will be a major deduction in your grade for this assignment. Following directions to the letter is a crucial skill for computer programming.

**Don't forget your comments!**
